| Teaching is something that I love to do. As an undergraduate, I served as a tutor and a Supplement Instructor for three-and-half out of my five years. I hope to earn a lot of teaching experience as a Ph.D. student through my Teaching Assitantship (TA) experience and my experience of teaching a class (or more) on my own. I was gripped by philosophy even before my undergraduate career because it sought to answer the big questions in life. I found philosophy deeply engaging and interesting, and above all rewarding. I would like to furnish my students with this appreciation of philosophy by not only providing clarity when philosophy can be abstruse, but also by emphasizing and explaining the importance of the topics we are discussing. I hope my students not only feel the practical weight and relevance of philosophical discussions and arguments, but also realize that philosophy is valuable for its own sake.
