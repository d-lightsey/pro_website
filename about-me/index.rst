My Wife
=========

| I am happily married with my high school sweetheart, Nancy Keilany Lightsey. We have been together for over 8 years now, and have been married for just over two years. My wife is also pursing a Ph.D. alongside me at Notre Dame, but not in philosophy! She is interested in biomedical engineering/bioengineering and is thus pursing a Ph.D. in that field. She also went to Texas A&M for her undergraduate studies, but she also obtained a masters degree from Johns Hopkins University. She is the kindest, loveliest, and most compassionate person you will ever meet. She is a perfect example of God’s grace in my life, and I immensely grateful for this grace everyday.

My Dog
========
| My wife and I have a dog named Bilbo (named, of course, after J.R.R. Tolkien’s character from The Hobbit [Tolkien is by far my favorite fiction author]). He is roughly a year-and-a-half old and loves three things: Food, cuddling, and sleep (in that order…). He is very precious to me and my wife, and we plan to get him more brothers or sisters whenever we get our own house! See the cute little guy on the left.

My Hobbies
============

| In my free time, I like to read (a lot), blog, YouTube channel, cook, watch movies and go hiking with my wife, and go running. When I read, I read mainly philosophy and theology books, but sometimes math, science, literature, and grammar/language books. I love cooking all sorts of food and I am attempting to get better. My favorite dish to cook is a Beef Wellington, which I made last Christmas and was utterly scrumptious. My favorite movies are The Lord of The Rings (all three) and any movie directed by Christopher Nolan. I enjoy hiking and running around beautiful areas, preferably near the water.
| 
| I run my blog and YouTube channel when I have time, but that is not as often as I would like. My blog is avalaible on my website `here <https://d-lightsey.github.io/pro_website/blog/>`_. This blog serves as a place for me to share my thoughts on different philosophical and theological topics. I intend mainly to discuss books I am reading at the moment, or any new idea with which I am toying around in my mind. None of my thoughts here should be viewed as my final opinion on the matter, nor even what I hold to be true. My goal is too allow the reader (you) to share in my thought process and perhaps give the reader some new ideas. Along with this, I will sometimes write about my experience as a Ph.D. student in philosophy at the University of Notre Dame.
| 
| I also have a YouTube Channel by the name of `The Variegated Philosopher <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHHRUElSQdKJV4qRozNempQ/>`_. My channel will cover similar topics as this blog, but will serve the purpose of more carefully documenting my Ph.D. experience through videos/vlogs and the like. Moreover, this blog will allow me to cover topics I do cover on my channel but in more detail. So, if you like what you read here, please check out my channel!
