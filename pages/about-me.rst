I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student in philosophy at The University of Notre Dame. Before coming to Notre Dame, I received a B.S. in Physics and a B.A. in Philosophy from Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas where I research was mainly focused on free will. My current research interests include: metaphysics (particularly causation, powers, and dispositions), free will (particularly agent-causal theories and the importance of history for acting freely), Philosophical Theology (particularly foreknowledge and freedom, providence, and divine action), among other things. When I am not reading, writing, or thinking about philosophy, Daniel enjoys watching movies with his wife and dog, cooking, volunteering at his church, going on a run, or making YouTube videos for his YouTube channel.
