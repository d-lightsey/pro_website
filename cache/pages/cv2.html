2021</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>A paper published in <em>Ephemeris</em>’s 2021 edition titled “A
Defense for the Compatibility of Science and Religion. This paper argues
that the claim that science has epistemic superiority over and above
philosophy and religion (or any field—sometimes called
<em>scientism</em>) shoots itself in the proverbial foot, and that the
claims of science and religion (specifically monotheistic religions) do
not necessarily beget conflict because they make distinctive but
complimenting claims about reality.</p></li>
